# accSDA
## Accelerated Sparse Discriminant Analysis

This package is currently under development, although most of the functionality is there already! You can now do sparse discriminant analysis with the package, but the visualization tools are being implemented and tested.

# Installation
To install the package from github you first need the `devtools` package. So install that if you haven't gotten it already!

Now you can proceed to install the package:
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("gumeo/accSDA")
library(accSDA)
```
And now you can start playing around with the package!
