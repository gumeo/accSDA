## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs.

## Notes
I got an e-mail from Brian Ripley about an error in the current version on CRAN (1.1.1): https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_accSDA.html

The error came from a LaTeX error in some internal documentation, this has now
been fixed.
