Description: Implementation of sparse linear discriminant analysis, which is a supervised
    classification method for multiple classes. Various novel optimization approaches to 
    this problem are implemented including alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), 
    proximal gradient (PG) and accelerated proximal gradient (APG) (See Atkins et al. arXiv:1705.07194). 
    Functions for performing cross validation are also supplied along with basic prediction 
    and plotting functions.
    Sparse zero variance discriminant analysis (SZVD) is also included in the package 
    (See Ames and Hong, arXiv:1401.5492). See the github wiki for a more extended description.
