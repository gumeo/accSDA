Description: Implementation of sparse linear discriminant analysis, which is a supervised
    classification method. Various optimization methods are implemented
    including alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), proximal gradient
    (PG) and accelerated proximal gradient (APG). Functions for performing cross
    validation are also supplied along with basic prediction and plotting functions.
    Sparse zero variance discriminant analysis (SZVD) is also included in the package.
    See the vignette and the github wiki for a more extended description.
