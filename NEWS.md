# accSDA 1.0.0

* This is the first CRAN release of the package, see further information of the content in the README file and the accompanying paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07194.pdf). You will find benchmarks and more convincing datasets to test the code in the paper, i.e. where we have a lot more variables compared to samples.

* This version of the package contains implementation of novel optimization approaches to solve the *sparse optimal scoring problem*. Future releases will focus on further improvements and additional tools to work with the results.
